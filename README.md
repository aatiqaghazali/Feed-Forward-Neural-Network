# Feed-Forward-Neural-Network
This repository contains working example of a FFNN in which every step is performed from scratch with-out using built-in libraries(i.e. gradient computation,normalization etc).
This code is developed as a semester project assigned by subject-teacher for Computor Vision course.
The purpose of this project was to give students a clear understanding of work-flow of a feed forward neural network that how every step is performed using numpy arrays and how gradients are calculated.

# Requirements
1. Python 3
2. Numpy
